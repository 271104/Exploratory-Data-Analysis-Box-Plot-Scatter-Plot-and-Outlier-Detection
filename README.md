# Box Plot and Scatter Plot Analysis with Outlier Detection

This project demonstrates the use of **Box Plot** and **Scatter Plot** for data visualization and explores how to detect and remove outliers using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method.

## Objective

- Understand the structure and use of Box Plots and Scatter Plots.
- Identify outliers in a dataset using box plot statistics.
- Remove outliers using the IQR method to obtain a clean dataset.

## Concepts Covered

### Box Plot
A box plot is a statistical chart that displays the distribution of data using five summary values:
- Minimum
- First Quartile (Q1)
- Median (Q2)
- Third Quartile (Q3)
- Maximum

It is especially useful for detecting outliers and comparing distributions.

### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot shows the relationship between two continuous variables. It helps visualize trends, patterns, and correlations.

### Outlier Detection using IQR
Outliers are data points that lie outside the normal range. Using the Interquartile Range (IQR), we define outliers as:
